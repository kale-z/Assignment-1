# Django-Practice-1
This is my first Django practice rendering a text histogram. A text is given in ```views.py``` and its words were counted, then appended into a dictionary to be looped over for rendering its elements as Listed Items (```<li>```).

_Note: after running the project locally, you may need to add the URL's slug manually_
